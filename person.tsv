the notion that men<br> should rule over other men<br>is a flawed premise.
yes. people never<br> thought that about say, vacuum<br>tubes, relays, or gears.

if you don't know who<br> those guys are, i suggest you<br>educate yourself.
[deleted] why us?<br> why not germany? china?<br>india? brazil?
you mean, why bother<br> making a better product<br>than everyone else?
because i don't know<br> how anyone can say those<br>shows are similar.
he doesn't answer<br> the question, he just uses<br>passionate language.
[deleted] do *you*<br> even know what you're talking<br>about anymore?
you're the first person<br> i've ever seen who actually<br>let characters die.
edit: the adage<br> is you attract what you are.<br>we have a winner.
i feel important<br> and they feel that the guild cares<br>for them. my advice?
or perhaps you do.<br> it's hard to tell if you are<br>being sarcastic.
i'm not heartily<br> endorsing him, just saying<br>he's the most likely.
plus, he went for his<br> gun the moment he found out<br>jesse knew the truth.
anyone who buys<br> from him wouldn't know about<br>the humble bundle.
everybody has<br> to be bigger and bolder<br>than the last person.
lewinsky's the one<br> everyone remembers, but<br>she wasn't the first.
there was also red<br> star's supporters and some chant<br>about vukovar.
fucking hell, i'm not<br> going any further than<br>that hitler story.
then everyone is.<br> all materiality<br>is void and worthless.

also, i assume,<br> sniffer dogs and the likes are<br>not trained for banners!
technically correct.<br> but, you know... someone was *wrong*<br>on the internet.
i would have to say<br> i would be the one sitting<br>alone without one.
i was the only<br> militia guy in system<br>that i know of m8.
but that would mean you<br> aren't agnostic, atheist<br>or a believer.
whether the kid was<br> fare evading or not is<br>irrelevant here.
she is acting out<br> what you (the impersonal<br>you) want her to be.
anyway, seems like<br> your issue is with dan, not<br>with me or finland.
i'm playing devils<br> advocate and assuming<br>op misheard the kid.

i like what i see<br> i think said person, would be<br>op based on the pic.

you are curious<br> about sexuality,<br>or maybe just cocks.
i killed those people.<br> that's what i can be." i could<br>prove it to you, too!

i don't see what you're<br> talking about when i look<br>at sweden or france.
black lagoon. trust me.<br> weird. i did both of those things<br>and had no problem.

i'm in the northeast<br> so i usually hit bill's<br>or bald eagle. you?
where can i meet you.<br> i've never seen another<br>black person before!
the fact that you claim<br> to 'see' this means you're smoking<br>something besides weed.
[deleted] oh she's<br> hot, but only in the "yes<br>i would" sort of way.
you have to scroll way<br> down to even find out who<br>this bradley guy is.
i think your answer<br> shows everything people need<br>to know about you.
there are too many<br> variables to blame one<br>group or another.
who is to say what<br> is suitable for what age?<br>you? the government?
"you know, a hoe tag,<br> ass antlers, a panama<br>city license plate."
you say you "believe<br> in love," but this is someone<br>who stopped loving you.
i guarantee you<br> she has been sexually<br>abused at some point.
oman was the one<br> i was trying to think of, or<br>whatever it's called.
problem solved, unless<br> i'm confused and don't know what<br>you're talking about.
..i'm onto you op<br> portuguese here, can confirm!<br>what's in it for me?

someone who can point<br> you in the right direction<br>for who can help you.
not saying this is<br> entirely false, but i'm<br>rather skeptical.

**this quote is not true**<br> ***this quote is not true*** ***this quote<br>is not true*** ***this. quote.

just because the kid<br> believes in god, doesn't mean<br>he's an "extremist".
saying that they are<br> "essentially defrauded"<br>is simply nonsense.
if you'd like to talk<br> parent to parent about<br>this, please pm me.
if you want to make<br> the kid feel really stupid<br>ask him these questions.

also, if you know<br> anyone else that would be<br>active, let me know.
i have no issue<br> with the kids talking about<br>"killing" each other.
i speak for all short<br> men who admire tall women:<br>"fuck thou, sir. fuck thou."
no one, because we're<br> adults who live in the real<br>world, and we need phones.
maybe robots take<br> over as farmers, but who<br>maintains the machines?
for example, you<br> can't be fired for being<br>black or a woman.
and you're trying to prove<br> anonymous people wrong<br>on the internet.
religious schisms<br> are fairly notorious<br>for this sort of thing.
i've seen user names<br> put like that before, but what<br>does it actually do?
either give your wife<br> what she wants or let her find<br>someone else who will.
hmmm... everyone else<br> at the range who shoots freestyle<br>uses that reference.
but why decide how<br> other people should behave?<br>who gives you that right?
to say that these kids<br> could not write an essay by<br>themselves is unfair.
because how does miss<br> cheater feel about herself<br>when she is with him?
because she does not<br> feel good about herself when<br>she is around them.

yeah, it's exactly<br> why she's making songs about<br>doing lines of blow.
people only join<br> law enforcement for the wrong<br>reasons nowadays.
todd killing that kid<br> is nothing compared to what<br>jesse thinks of walt.
the simple fact is<br> that a depressed heroin<br>addict killed himself.
funny thing, there is<br> literally the same loophole<br>in the french language.
it does not allow<br> for the rape of adult men<br>by adult women.
you are literally<br> the most politically aligned<br>person in the world.
and in what context?<br> also what continent are<br>you referring to?
where i'm from, he looks<br> like another dumb, sludgy<br>underclass redneck.
it doesn't matter<br> if he didn't see anything<br>wrong with what he did.
"mind blowing" endings<br> end up being nice endings<br>with a clever twist.
i'm sorry, but you're<br> just wrong and your reasoning<br>is painfully flawed.
[deleted] should be<br> "actually", in case anyone<br>was still wondering.
there's no "normal" or<br> "abnormal." maybe he just<br>likes washing dishes.
i feel like there should<br> be a support group for us<br>(the fans who can't go).
[deleted] i knew<br> somebody was gonna come<br>with this. lol.
also, it's kinda<br> like saying a smart person<br>can't hallucinate.

the only reason<br> people discredit him is<br>because he talks shit.
wow. she kicked you out.<br> she doesn't trust you. you were<br>toxic together.
that might as well be<br> the same person i have two<br>related to this!

they're at a place where<br> characters feel powerful<br>when they're supposed to.
how do characters<br> become part of the meta?<br>probably by group vote.
that's who we're talking<br> about and no, that isn't<br>worth courting at all.
perhaps you only<br> thought you were awake but you<br>were actually dreaming?
the pros don't want white<br> dirty smoke like the smoker<br>above produces.
uneducated<br> tamil people rarely speak<br>english or hindi.

i see mixed comments<br> here about whether people<br>were conscious or not.
i've heard people say<br> similar things, but i don't<br>know where it comes from.

i can't understand<br> why you people can forgive<br>such atrocities.
the batter remains<br> at bat and the fielder is<br>charged with an error.
everyone else on<br> the road is an idiot.<br>be aware of that.
i don't think the fan<br> is loud unless you're going<br>for complete silence.
i feel like i am<br> being asked to choose between<br>stalin and hitler.

also, what the hell<br> is this guy talking about<br>air in his stomach????
i completely felt<br> that i was literally one<br>with the universe.
because no matter<br> who won in the coup attempt,<br>democracy died.
like i said, the poor<br> white man's vote doesn't really<br>need explanation.
i was referring<br> to the other kids (the girls)<br>looking similar.
this is the same trump<br> who called mccain a loser<br>for being captured.
you guys are just wired<br> differently i mean, what is<br>this, criminal minds?

nobody cares who<br> works in boardroom if people<br>can get employment.
but apparently<br> that wasn't enough to stop<br>someone killing cops.
they're talking about<br> "the original feature,"<br>"enjoyed by many."
i'm not saying that's<br> the case, but some very smart<br>people have said that.
by the same logic,<br> one could say the same about<br>christianity.
this is part of why<br> trump saying "kill the families"<br>offends me so much.
as sean was married,<br> his wife is the one to get<br>the information.
"my problem is x!"<br> "proof?" "i couldn't find any<br>examples of x.
in fact the other<br> person responding to you<br>lays out some good points.
and they were older<br> children too, like school age, not<br>toddlers or infants.

i'm going to be<br> the devil's advocate here<br>and simply say *no*.
that is about where<br> one would be with two adults<br>making ~$70-80k a year.
almost no one is.<br> the people that are we call<br>models or actors.
you don't hammer on<br> something that's not solid, or<br>the whole thing gives way.
they'd be thinking, "why<br> would they get this girl to lie<br>if he's innocent?
:o i don't know what<br> i am. b8.5 s5 only comes<br>in 3.0t i'm so scared.
[deleted] oh yeah,<br> he gave us what he promised,<br>a rambling review.
at this point, i think<br> celibacy is what god<br>is leading me to.
the former are just<br> ignorant, the latter are<br>lying hypocrites.
his exact words were,<br> "voodoo and black magic are<br>very real forces.
the difference is what<br> he sees as "awkward" i see<br>as untrustworthy.
if i was a straight<br> sexual person who knows<br>how i would end up.
it only takes one<br> senseless mistake to kill you<br>or somebody else.
white or transparent<br> could really mean anything<br>for her court members.
thankfully, i don't<br> think he gives a shit about<br>fake internet points.

black science mans lives<br> matter every day we stray<br>further from god's light.
this guy and trump were<br> like mirror images when<br>he was campaigning.
i have a friend who<br> got herpes from the first man<br>she ever slept with.
those people saying<br> that you were low balling were<br>definitely right.
just like anyone<br> that says it won't happen is<br>just speculating.
"trust strangers more than<br> people you know" just doesn't<br>sound like good advice.
nothing is gay if<br> you say no homo pretty<br>spot on description.
if dan is for gay<br> marriage, other dan will be<br>against gay marriage.
strut. that's what i do<br> when gay guys openly cat<br>call and hit on me.
talking with a trump<br> supporter is like playing<br>chess with a pigeon.
frankly, i think le<br> exploited an accident.<br>or an "accident."
i cant exactly<br> mentally pinpoint where their<br>vanishing point is.
dead right. you maybe<br> right, but if you are dead what<br>does it matter? yield.
white lines indicate<br> indicate two different lanes<br>in one direction.
that is why i was<br> so shocked by the property<br>manager's response.
but where exactly?<br> i live in europe, but no<br>mr. mime for me!
you're right, but i mean<br> people that are familiar<br>and still call it that.
and no matter what,<br> police should not be killing<br>innocent people.
what i like about<br> subaru is he's closer<br>to reality.
about betelgeuse?<br> about the things he knows from<br>the alternate lives?
and we all know trump<br> calls the shots with the russians.<br>it's not a riddle.

well, you're forgetting<br> that we have a media<br>genius candidate.
i don't know who these<br> women are or exactly<br>what their values are.
definitely beef<br> cake!!! what do they say when you<br>ask if they're pretty?
anyone here could<br> not fire robin and not trade<br>anyone of note.
but to say that ned<br> won the throne for robert is<br>fucking retarded.
strong praise from a man<br> who probably knows what the fuck<br>he's talking about.
no, not everyone.<br> absolutely not. hell, most<br>people don't actually.
[deleted] whose wounds?<br> how many readers even<br>liked god serena?

probably just a troll.<br> if you're a hugger, stop it.<br>you mean *all* genders.
well i am a straight<br> white man and i've got to tell<br>you it's amazing.
isn't that the most<br> blatant example of false<br>advertising, though?
the guy seems pretty<br> honest and he's attacking<br>trump pretty badly.
just be circumspect,<br> and don't overly target<br>one person or group.
edit: as someone<br> pointed out, obsidian<br>gets no royalties.
no. i like you. stay.<br> good dog. someone just told me<br>about grape solar.
what if the person<br> or people attacking you<br>are faster than you?
another option<br> is going doctor shopping<br>if you are able.

children were always<br> susceptible to abuse<br>from persons they know.
my favorite part was<br> snape leading the resistance<br>when there was no hope.
this is what we are,<br> not some other different thing.<br>people want to fuck.
anyone know what<br> the typical layoff is<br>for something like that?
he obviously<br> wants to punish you and who<br>knows what he will do.

this is why tricky<br> person is a better phrase<br>han stranger danger.

math ia advice?<br> does it surprise me that op<br>is ukrainian?
what's wrong with asking<br> trump to confirm that he has<br>no ties to nambla?
not at all. there is<br> male and female, and sometimes<br>something goes screwy.
honestly, hate or<br> love him, but he's talking on<br>the right issue here.
the person who's cheap,<br> is usually the person<br>who spends more money.
it's been consistent<br> that she knows he hates birthday<br>parties, just not why.
[removed] trump may be<br> dangerous, but that doesn't<br>make him a rifle.
stomping makes you seem<br> like a fucking idiot<br>against real players.

i was wondering<br> the same, can you or someone<br>pm me as well?
she just wants answers.<br> she never claimed 'hillary<br>clinton killed her son'.
now my boyfriend is<br> surprised that women agree<br>to date men at all.
which possibly makes<br> strand the adversary (if<br>those two are opposed)?
any evidence<br> that that happened other than<br>urick claiming it?

don't see why you'd sleep<br> with someone you don't know such<br>basic things about.
trump dodges the draft<br> then says he wanted to be<br>injured in combat?

however, thais are<br> running a campaign of "good<br>guys in, bad guys out".
that's awesome. no there<br> is no meaningful difference<br>in what they call you.
was wondering if<br> anyone likes it and what<br>your dosages are.

i can't, feeling weird<br> like that is exactly what<br>i want to avoid.
just because they cat<br> called, doesn't mean they're okay<br>with her being raped.

by what measure was<br> hillary the 11th most<br>liberal senator?

"this is officer<br> mallon, i repeat this is<br>officer mallon.
because she's the one<br> who showed me how similar<br>men and women are.
i suspect those stats<br> are something like trump does well<br>in the white, 75k group.
if it was true, i'd<br> hope at least one person asked<br>to do this would not.
she looks like someone<br> from final fantasy v.<br>take that as you likes.
like there is someone<br> who's job is to just sit there<br>and spy on people.
what's ridiculous<br> about the reaction he's<br>getting exactly?
the issue is, what<br> about people who just want<br>to set off the bomb?

trump doesn't do this.<br> [deleted] it does look like<br>another planet.
seriously, if<br> you act like a kid, you'll be<br>treated like a kid.
keep being awesome<br> no one saying brandon lee<br>or edward norton?
and i am pretty<br> sure that wouldn't be legal<br>where you are either?

as someone who's been<br> cheated on, trust me, he'll be<br>thankful you told him.

everyone loves him<br> (except his kids who know him<br>well sometimes struggle).
are you telling gay<br> people their concerns about<br>trump are unfounded?
why would you ask some<br> strangers about what picture<br>should represent you?
stop whining about<br> how people are chanting you<br>fucking cry babies.
she chose to defend<br> someone she believed guilty.<br>that's it period.
anyone ever<br> notice how inconsistent<br>the motion is though?
why, when she does win,<br> will the election be rigged?<br>what am i missing?

cnn talking<br> about trump propaganda.<br>oh the irony.
eli has always<br> preferred throwing to guys who<br>are big tall targets.
they're there because they're<br> powerful, or have catered<br>to those who are. sharks!
is it in response<br> to what he is doing or<br>what you want to do?

what's your plan if you<br> ever find anyone? yep!<br>they were speaking welsh.
[deleted] aye, but<br> everything's weird if you're not<br>familiar with it.
not to mention how<br> does he know the other guy<br>is a drug dealer??
well, you may think so,<br> but millions of christians would<br>disagree with that.
as a formerly<br> homeless person, yeah same here.<br>shepherd's pie two thoughts.
institutional<br> racism and racism<br>isn't the same thing.
as far as i know<br> trump simply said illegals<br>will be deported.

it's. the. way. they. read.<br> individual. words. off.<br>the. teleprompter.

i mean i'm pretty<br> sure that it was conroe by<br>that numbering scheme...
[deleted] how do<br> we know she knows her shit if<br>she's always lying.
i mean if you are<br> good at everything you do<br>there is no challenge.
but i don't think he's<br> being honest with himself<br>about hillary.
fucking eve. that is<br> one of the most laughable<br>statements i know of.
my parents think i'm<br> crazy (i am but) and will<br>not listen to me.
they're lying because<br> someone they're trying to impress<br>knows their user name.

behind every joke<br> there has to be some truth, or<br>some kind of message.
i'm a sad person<br> :s nah, that's the middle ground<br>you are thinking of.
